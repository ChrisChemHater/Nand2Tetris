I have tried to code elegantly despite the fact that I am an extremely unprofessional C++ programmer.

Compile Environment: Windows 10 Family, Visual Studio 2019, C++ 17 std.

Third Party libary:

- boost 1.75.0
- [cmdline](https://github.com/tanakh/cmdline): A simple command line parser for C++.

I am still working on it in my spare time. This repository will be updated with rest projects in this course.
